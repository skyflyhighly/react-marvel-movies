Sometimes we'll get error while creating a react app. This may be the case of nodejs version. In that case, you need to downgrade the nodejs version. If you have nodejs version 17+, it's better to use version 16+.<a href = "https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/" target="_blank"> Click the link </a> to solve the problem.
